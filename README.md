# CoIR: Compressive Implicit Radar

This repository provides code for the paper **``CoIR: Compressive Implicit Radar''**, by Sean M. Farrell, Vivek Boominathan, Nathaniel Raymondi, Ashutush Sabharwal, and Ashok Veeraraghavan. Contact: smf5@rice.edu

CoIR is an analysis by synthesis method that leverages the implicit neural network bias in convolutional decoders and compressed sensing to perform high accuracy radar imaging. 

Paper and code will be released upon acceptance to ICCP 2023

## Installation

The code is written in python and relies on pytorch. The following libraries are required: 
- python 3
- pytorch
- numpy
- skipy
- matplotlib

Code to extract/preprocess experimental radar data is developed in Matlab.
